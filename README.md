# Matplotlib_and_Seaborn
Proyecto de estudio de las librerias Matplotlib y Seaborn para visualizacion de datos. Curso de @Platzi 

As a result of completing the Basic Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn course, I learned a number of skills that I believe will be very useful for my future data analysis work. These skills include being able to create various types of visualizations, such as bar graphs, line plots, scatter plots, and heat maps, using both Matplotlib and Seaborn. I also learned how to customize the appearance of these visualizations by adding titles, labels, and legends, and how to adjust colors, styles, and other design elements to make the visualizations more appealing and informative.

Another important skill that I learned was how to work with different types of data, including numerical, categorical, and time series data, and how to choose the appropriate visualization techniques for each type of data. For example, I learned how to use histograms and kernel density plots to visualize distributions of numerical data, and how to use box plots and violin plots to compare distributions between different groups of data.
